## Cyberpunk Driver ##
In this game, you drive a retro-futuristic car in a cyberpunk world to complete objectives!

### Game Plan
1. The core mechanic is a driving simulator on a long stretch of road. Ramps, corners, and obstacles will be found on the
road. Collect cassette tapes on the road to earn points and avoid the obstacles! The points will be displayed on a corner via
canvas text. 
2. Input: Controlled with WASD, viewed in third-person.
3. Synthwave and music based on the game *Distance*.

5. It is 1984. You are Miami's greatest detective, and you have been tasked by the police chief to collect the cassette tapes lost by 
a crime lord's goon during a high-speed chase. These tapes contain valuable blackmail against said crime lord. Collect all 15 tapes to win the game, 
but be careful! The road is riddled with obstacles, such as other drivers, booby traps left behind by the criminals, and other hazards. 

## Set Targets ##
1. A fully designed road, the player's car is drivable, and the surrounding environment has been established (skybox, buildings, etc.)
2. On top of the "low-bar", collision detection of obstacles (if you crash the game will ask you to restart or quit the game), 
collision detection of collecting the cassette tapes (add points to score), and placing the obstacles and cassette tapes throughout 
the road will be added to be fulfill my target.
3. Give the player lives. Start off with three lives, and when you make a collision with an obstacle you lose one and when you 
collect a cassette tape you earn a life. Perhaps add a flashing animation to the car when you crash and "boosting" animation for
when you colleect a tape. Pehaps make the game run endlessly.

## Timeline ##
1. Week of 11/23: Work on setting up the game environment. Get models of cars, obstacles, and other props. Later into the week 
begin the driver code for the car controller.
2. Week of 11/30: Work on collision detection code. Refine the game environment. 
3. Week of 12/7: Fine tuning.

## Fortification Patrol ##
Command a battalion of defenders from your castle against a wave of barbaric warriors! 
You can shoot arrows, throw stones, and pour boiling oil down on the invaders. The invaders will attack the castle walls
and front gate. Both the wall and gate will have health. If one of them falls, you lose! Your defenders will have health too; the attackers
will also shoot arrows at you, and they have several mighty trebuchets at their disposal. If a defender dies, he will respawn in 10 seconds. 
If you die, you will respawn in 10 seconds as well, but you only have three lives. If you run out, your castle will be leaderless, and it 
will fall to the invaders. The invaders will respawn a bit quicker and they will outnumber your forces, but they have lower health than you and 
your soldiers. After each invader dies 3-5 times (depending on the class of invader, such as beserker, common infantry, special, etc.), the wave ends.
